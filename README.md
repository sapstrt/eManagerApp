The Ultimate Expense Manager
============================

I have multiple bank accounts, a few cards and am constanlty purchasing stuff on the internet and as and when I feel like. I spend a lot of time back tracking my way through my expenses. I need this app. 

Welcome to the ultimate expense manager. An app that you can take along shopping. Swiped your credit card somewhere and forgot about it? Don't worry this app will automatically file an expense as soon as your phone gets the message from the credit card companies.

..Time to update your banks with your latest contact numbers, I think!
